touch (make files: .js, .css, .html, .txt, etc) 

pwd (presently working directory) shows where you are 

if we want to see the actual physical path with all of the symlinks use
-p flag (pwd -p)

ls shows current folders and files in directory 

(you can pass a path to ls to check files and folders in another directory
without actually changing directories) 

ls -a shows hidden and visible files 

ls -l shows information about file or directory 
(file mode, # of links, owner name, group name, # of bytes, month,
day of month file was last modified, hour and minute last modified,
and pathname)

ls -lh changes bits to human oriented sizing 1.7k or 35M

ls -lhs sort by size bigger files first 

ls -lt sort by last modified time 

ls -r reverses listing (lsr reverses size to show smallest files first)

ln create a link between two files (creates hard link)

ln source.file target.file

ln -f forcing link to already existing file (ln a.txt b.txt, if b.txt exists)

ln -s creates a symbolic link to link directories and directories 
symbolic link the operating system creates a new file that 
points to the target file or directory 

mkdir create directory 

mkdir -p a/b/c nested directories 

cp a.txt b.txt copy single file 

cp a.txt b.txt foo copying files into a directory (foo) with same names 

cp -R foo bar coping directory to another directory 

cp -f a.txt b.txt is a force copy when you have different file owners 

rm a.txt remove a file 

mv a.txt b.txt allows you to copy a file to another and remove it 
from a location
